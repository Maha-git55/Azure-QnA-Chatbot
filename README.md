# Azure-QnA-Chatbot
Added complete Azure QnA Chatbot project.

Azure Custom Question Answering Chatbot
This project is a practical implementation of the Custom Question Answering feature within Microsoft Azure's AI services. I have built an intelligent chatbot that can answer questions from its own knowledge base.

üéØ Project Overview
Using the Azure AI Language service, I created a chatbot system that:

Custom Knowledge Base: Learns from your own data (URLs)
Chit-Chat Feature: Can converse in a professional style
Smart QnA Management: Can edit and add questions
Live Testing: Can be tested in real-time
Cloud Deployment: Deployed for production use

üõ†Ô∏è Azure Services Used
Azure AI Language Service - Core NLP service
